# Multi-Stage Builds

Multi-stage builds use the standard Dockerfile syntax, with multiple stages separated with `FROM` commands. They give you a repeatable build with minimal dependencies.

You won't see multi-stage builds used everywhere, but they're a great way to centralize your toolset - developers and build servers just need Docker and the source code, all the tools come packaged in Docker images, so everyone's using the same versions.

## Reference

- [Multi-stage build docs](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/)

<details>
  <summary>Sample Dockerfiles</summary>

It's the standard `docker build` command for multi-stage builds. The Dockerfile syntax uses multiple `FROM` instructions; the patterns are the same for all languages, but the individual details are specific.

These are samples in the major languages:

- [Java app using Maven build](https://github.com/sixeyed/widgetario/blob/main/src/products-api/java/Dockerfile)
- [Go application using Go modules](https://github.com/sixeyed/widgetario/blob/main/src/stock-api/golang/Dockerfile)
- [.NET Core app using Alpine images](https://github.com/sixeyed/widgetario/blob/main/src/web/dotnet/Dockerfile)

## Multi-Stage Dockerfiles

We'll start by using the original build engine so it's clear what's happening in the build - later we'll switch to BuildKit which has better performance:

```
# on macOS or Linux:
export DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0

# OR with PowerShell:
$env:DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0
```

Here's a [simple multi-stage Dockerfile](./simple/Dockerfile):

- the `base` stage uses Alpine and simulates adding some dependencies
- the `build` stage builds on the base and simulates an app build
- the `test` stage starts from the build output and simulates automated testing
- the final stage starts from base and copies in the build output

ðŸ“‹ Build an image called `simple` from the `labs/multi-stage/simple` Dockerfile.

<details>
  <summary>Not sure how?</summary>

```
# just a normal build:
docker build -t simple ./labs/multi-stage/simple/
```

</details><br/>

> All the stages run, but the final app image only has content explicitly added from earlier stages.

Run a container from the image and it prints content from the base and build stages:

```
docker run simple
```

> The final image doesn't have the additional content from the test stage.

# BuildKit and build targets

BuildKit is an alternative build engine in Docker. It's heavily optimized for multi-stage builds, running stages in parallel and skipping stages if the output isn't used.

Switch to BuildKit by setting an environment variable:

```
# on macOS or Linux:
export DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1

# OR with PowerShell: 
$env:DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1
```
this will through the error
Now repeat the build for the simple Dockerfile - this time Docker will use BuildKit:

```
docker build -t simple:buildkit ./labs/multi-stage/simple/
```

> You'll see output from different stages at the same time - and if you look closely you'll see the test stage is skipped.

ðŸ“‹ Run a container from the new image. Is the output the same? Compare the image details.

<details>
  <summary>Not sure how?</summary>

```
# run a container - the output is the same:
docker run simple:buildkit

# list images - they're the same size but not the same image:
docker image ls simple
```

</details><br/>

BuildKit skips the test stage because none of the output is used in later stages. You can explicitly build an image up to a specific stage with the `target` flag:

```
docker build -t simple:test --target test ./labs/multi-stage/simple/
```

- `--target` states the target stage, Docker will build all stages up to and including the named one

> This image is the output of the test stage *not* the final stage.

ðŸ“‹ Run a container from the test build, printing the contents of the build.txt file.

<details>
  <summary>Not sure how?</summary>

```
# no output here - the test stage has no CMD instruction
docker run simple:test

# run the cat command to see the output
docker run simple:test cat /build.txt
```

</details><br/>

> The output is from the build stage plus the test stage.


## Simple Go application

Real multi-stage builds use an SDK (Software Development Kit) image to compile the app in the build stage and a smaller runtime image (with no build tools) to package the compiled app.

The images you use and the commands you run are different for each language, but you'll find [official images on Docker Hub for all the major platforms](https://hub.docker.com/search?q=&type=image&image_filter=official&category=languages), including:

- [maven](https://hub.docker.com/_/maven) and [gradle](https://hub.docker.com/_/gradle) to build Java apps - using [openjdk]() for the runtime image
- [python](https://hub.docker.com/_/python) - has Pip installed for dependencies
- [node](https://hub.docker.com/_/node) for Node.js apps - this has NPM so you can install packages in the build stage
- [golang](https://hub.docker.com/_/golang) for Go apps - they don't need a runtime so the final image can start from [scratch](https://hub.docker.com/_/scratch)
- [dotnet/sdk](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-sdk/) for .NET Core/6 apps, using [dotnet/runtime](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-runtime/) or [dotnet/aspnet](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-aspnet/) for the final app image

We won't cover different languages in detail. The [whoami Dockerfile](./whoami/Dockerfile) shows how the pattern works, using a Go application:

- the builder stages starts from the Go SDK image
- it installs the OS packages needed to build the app
- then it copies the library list and runs `go mod download` to install the app's dependencies
- next it copies the source code and compiles the app
- the final app image sets up the container environment
- then it copies in the compiled output from the builder

ðŸ“‹ Build an image called `whoami` from the folder `labs/multi-stage/whoami`.

<details>
  <summary>Not sure how?</summary>

```
docker build -t whoami ./labs/multi-stage/whoami/
```

</details><br/>

> You'll see all the stage output from BuildKit.

SDK images are typically very large, having the whole build toolset. You don't want to use an SDK image in your final stage, otherwise you'll have all that stuff in your app image.

ðŸ“‹ Compare the sizes of the `whoami` and `golang` images.

<details>
  <summary>Not sure how?</summary>

```
docker pull golang:1.16.4-alpine

docker image ls -f reference=whoami -f reference=golang
```

</details><br/>

> Woah! The SDK image is over 300MB; the app image is under 10MB.


The app is a simple web server. Run a container publishing a random port and find the port:

```
docker run -d -P --name whoami1 whoami

docker port whoami1
```

> The `EXPOSE` instruction tells Docker the target port for the container; when you use the `-P` flag Docker publishes all exposed ports.

Now you can use the app:

```
curl localhost:<port>
```

> The server just prints some details about the environment and the request.

## Lab

Apps need special Linux permissions to listen on the standard HTTP ports - even inside a container.

The whoami app supports an option to configure the port it listens on, so you can use a non-standard port and potentially run with tighter security.

Your goal for this lab is to run the whoami app in a container - using the `-port` application argument to listen on a specific port. What happens when you run a container with the `-P` (`--publish-all`) option? Does Docker map the new port correctly?

What do you need to do to run a working container?

## Cleanup

Cleanup by removing all containers:

```
docker rm -f $(docker ps -aq)
```
